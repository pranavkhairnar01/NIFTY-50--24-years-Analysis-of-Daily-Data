# NIFTY-50--24-years-Analysis-of-Daily-Data
I hope this post finds you well. I recently conducted a detailed analysis of NIFTY-50 daily data spanning the last 24 years (1999-2023) using Python, and I'm excited to share the key insights with you. The analysis involved the use of popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Summary Statistics:
I started by computing summary statistics, revealing interesting insights into the NIFTY-50's historical performance. Notably, the index has exhibited a mean daily return of -0.0167%, with a maximum one-day gain of 17.69% and a maximum one-day fall of 12.24%. These extremes occurred on May 18, 2009, and May 17, 2004, respectively.

Volatility Analysis:
Volatility is a crucial factor in assessing risk and return. The analysis revealed the following volatilities:

Daily Volatility: 1.3571%
Weekly Volatility: 0.03%
Monthly Volatility: 0.0647%
Yearly Volatility: 0.2892%
The decreasing trend in volatility over longer time horizons suggests that investors willing to hold NIFTY-50 investments for extended periods may reduce their risk exposure. However, it's essential to acknowledge that even at longer time horizons, the index remains volatile.

Correlation Insights:
The analysis uncovered a negative correlation of -0.62% between Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and dividends. This suggests an inverse relationship between these two variables, indicating that periods of higher P/E ratios might be associated with lower dividend yields and vice versa.

Outlier Analysis:
Interestingly, there are significantly fewer outliers for Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio and Dividend Yield on a daily basis. However, outliers increase notably for P/E ratios and daily returns. This highlights the potential for more extreme fluctuations in these metrics on a day-to-day basis.

In conclusion, this analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the NIFTY-50's historical performance, offering valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.
