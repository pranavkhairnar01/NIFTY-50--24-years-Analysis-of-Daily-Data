I'm thrilled to share the findings of my in-depth analysis of NIFTY-50 daily data spanning the last 24 years (1999-2023) using Python and popular data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

Summary Statistics:
To kick off, let's delve into the key summary statistics. The NIFTY-50 has shown a mean daily return of -0.0167%, with the most significant one-day gain recorded at 17.69% on May 18, 2009, and the most substantial one-day fall at 12.24% on May 17, 2004.

Volatility Analysis:
Volatility, a critical factor in assessing risk and return, exhibited interesting patterns:

Daily Volatility: 1.3571%
Weekly Volatility: 0.03%
Monthly Volatility: 0.0647%
Yearly Volatility: 0.2892%
A notable observation is the decreasing trend in volatility over longer time horizons. This suggests that holding NIFTY-50 investments for extended periods may potentially reduce risk exposure. However, even with longer horizons, the index remains inherently volatile.

An intriguing discovery is the drastic reduction in volatility for both Dividend Yield and Index Return after 2008. The Standard Deviation for these metrics notably decreased around 2008.

Correlation Insights:
Exploring correlations, a negative correlation of -0.62% between the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio and dividends emerged. This implies an inverse relationship, suggesting that higher P/E ratios may be linked with lower dividend yields and vice versa.

Outlier Analysis:
In the realm of outliers, the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio and Dividend Yield experience significantly fewer outliers on a daily basis. Conversely, outliers spike notably for P/E ratios and daily returns, indicating the potential for more extreme fluctuations in these metrics on a day-to-day basis.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this analysis offers a comprehensive understanding of NIFTY-50's historical performance, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

Feel free to share your perspectives on this analysis.
